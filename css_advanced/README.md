### Features:
- **Responsive Layout:** The webpage adjusts to different screen sizes using the viewport meta tag for better accessibility on mobile devices.
- **FontAwesome Integration:** Icons such as stars for rating tutorials and social media icons are added through FontAwesome.
- **Images:** Placeholder images are used for logos and sections such as tutorials and experts. Replace these with actual images in the `images` folder.
  
### Dependencies:
- FontAwesome is used for icons, loaded via the `<script>` tag from the FontAwesome CDN.

### How to Run the Project:
1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in a browser.
3. Ensure the internet connection is active for FontAwesome icons to load.
4. Replace placeholder images and content as needed.

### Folder Structure:
- **HTML File:** Contains the main structure and layout of the website.
- **Images Folder:** All referenced images in the project should be stored in an `images` folder relative to the HTML file. These images include instructor photos, tutorial images, and logos.

### Future Improvements:
- Add more interactivity using JavaScript, such as dynamic FAQ sections or tutorial registration.
- Enhance styling with CSS to make the website more visually appealing.
- Implement a backend to support user accounts, course tracking, and payment integration for memberships.
